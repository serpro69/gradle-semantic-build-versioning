/**
 * <h3>General</h3>
 * This global Spock extension adds six interceptors that automatically fill in all shared and non-shared fields and all
 * feature method parameters that are of type {@link io.github.serpro69.gradle.versioning.TestRepository} or
 * {@link org.gradle.testkit.runner.GradleRunner} and are still unassigned (i. e. have value {@code null}) at injection
 * time.
 * <p/>
 * {@code TestRepository} fields and parameters are injected before {@code GradleRunner} fields and parameters, so that
 * the {@code TestRepository} fields can be used as project directory for the {@code GradleRunner} instances. For shared
 * {@code GradleRunner} fields you can of course also only use shared {@code TestRepository} fields, as non-shared
 * fields are not yet injected at that time.
 *
 * <h3>Shared Fields</h3>
 *
 * {@link spock.lang.Shared @Shared} fields are filled in and cleaned up in a specification interceptor. This means that all
 * iterations of all feature methods see the same value with the same underlying data on disk and also all setup and
 * cleanup methods see those values. They are created before the specification starts and are cleaned up after the
 * specification ends.
 *
 * <h3>Non-shared Fields</h3>
 *
 * Non-shared fields are filled in and cleaned up in an iteration interceptor. This means that the fields are filled in
 * at the start of each iteration. Iteration means that for data-driven feature methods with a {@code where:} block the
 * fields are filled at the start of each individual iteration and at the start means before any setup methods. The
 * filled in objects and their underlying data on disk is available until the end of the iteration, i. e. until after
 * all cleanup methods.
 *
 * <h3>Parameters</h3>
 *
 * Parameters are filled in and cleaned up in a feature method interceptor. This means that each call of the feature
 * method (i. e. each individual iteration) gets individual injected values with individual underlying data on disk and
 * they are cleaned up as soon as the feature method is finished. Those values and their underlying data on disk are not
 * available during setup methods or in cleanup methods.
 * <p/>
 * As of Spock 1.0 special care has to be taken for data-driven features (methods with a {@code where:} block) due to
 * <a href="https://github.com/spockframework/spock/issues/651">issue #651</a> and
 * <a href="https://github.com/spockframework/spock/issues/652">issue #652</a>.<br/>
 * This means for a data-driven feature where a parameter has to be injected
 * <ul>
 *     <li>all data variables and all to-be-injected parameters have to be defined as method parameters</li>
 *     <li>all method parameters have to be assigned a value in the {@code where:} block</li>
 *     <li>
 *         the order of the method parameters has to be identical to the order of the data variables in the
 *         {@code where:} block
 *     </li>
 *     <li>the to-be-injected parameters have to be set to {@code null} in the {@code where:} block</li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>Example:</b>
 * <pre>
 * def test(a, b, TestRepository testRepository) {
 *     expect:
 *     true
 *
 *     where:
 *     a    | b
 *     'a1' | 'b1'
 *     'a2' | 'b2'
 *
 *     and:
 *     testRepository = null
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>{@code TestRepository} instances</h3>
 *
 * When injecting {@code TestRepository} instances, they by default are filled in with work repositories that have a
 * worktree available. If you instead want a field or parameter to be filled with an underlying bare repository, you can
 * annotate the respective field or parameter with the
 * {@link io.github.serpro69.gradle.versioning.spock.extensions.git.Bare @Bare} annotation which makes the interceptors create
 * and inject bare repositories instead.
 *
 * <h3>{@code GradleRunner} instances</h3>
 *
 * When injecting {@code GradleRunner} instances, they by default have a newly created temporary directory per instance
 * as project directory. Alternatively you can specify what should be used as project directory by annotating the
 * respective field or parameter with a
 * {@link io.github.serpro69.gradle.versioning.spock.extensions.gradle.ProjectDirProvider @ProjectDirProvider} annotation. The
 * project directory of the injected Gradle runner will also get prepared with
 * <ul>
 *     <li>a {@code settings.gradle} file where this plugin is applied,</li>
 *     <li>a {@code gradle.properties} file where JaCoCo is configured properly and</li>
 *     <li>
 *         an empty {@code semantic-build-versioning.gradle} file that enables this plugin for the root project
 *         with default settings.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
